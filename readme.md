  3. Open launch4j and open the ```out/WINDOWS/portCheckerEXEConfig.xml``` within launch4j, and change the out path and jar path to that of the out path and jar path on your machine (JAR path should be ```out/bin/portChecker.jar``` and out path should be ```out/bin/PortChecker.exe``` so it matches with the server for update debugging
  4. You're all set. Look at [compiling](#compiling) for compilation instructions
